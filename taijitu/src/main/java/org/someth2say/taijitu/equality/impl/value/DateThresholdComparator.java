//Warning: DateThresholdComparator can not be a Hasher!

/**
 * A comparator of date and time instances.
 * Will identify instances as `equal` is the difference between the instance is below the defined threshold.
 * Default threshold is 1000 milisecods (1 second).
 * <p>
 * This is one of those equalizers with an special case.
 * Think about tree instance: T, T1=T+600, T2=T+1200.
 * As per equality contract, T=T1, and T1=T2. But, when using this equalizer's definition, the transitivity fails: T!=T2.
 * <p>
 * Despite of this, this equalizer is still present as have proven useful when comparing sequences of events coming from different sources.
 * Events should not only share the same information, but should also occur at the same time to be considered equal.
 * As the clocks of the sources may be slightly desynchronized, small time differences may occur, but should be acceptable.รง
 * This equalizer implements this behavior, assuming the risk of breaking absolute order in some cases.
